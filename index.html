<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This site was created with the intention of answering the following question:</p>
<p><strong>How has the quality of education/opportunities in the past 30 years differed in different kinds of schools, as well as for different types of British Columbian students (i.e., indigenous? Special needs?)?</strong></p>
<p>Note that although this is just one question, it is a very complex one, and so naturally, a lot of data is required to answer it. Thus, this website uses <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/">open data from British Columbia</a>–specifically, <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-schools-grade-to-grade-transition">the 1992-2021 data on grade-to-grade transition published by British Columbia Education Analytics</a>. To gather information regarding the districts, this site also uses <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-schools-school-district-information">information regarding each district’s office, also published by the British Columbia Education Analytics</a>. By using the grade-to-grade transitions as a metric for the quality of education/opportunities, we can formulate a nuanced response to the question.</p>
<p>If you wish to see the Github repository for this site, <a href="https://github.com/CoderWarren/An-Analysis-of-BC-Grade-Transitions">you can find it here</a>.</p>
