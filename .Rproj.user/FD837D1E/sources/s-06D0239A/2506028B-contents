## About this site

This site seeks to explore the following question: 

**How has the quality of education/opportunities (as measured by grade-to-grade transition) in the past 30 years differed in different kinds of schools, as well as different types of BC students (i.e., indigenous? Special needs?)?**

Note that although this is just one question, it is a very complex one, and we will soon see that a lot of data is required to answer it.

This website uses [open data from British Columbia](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/)--specifically, [the 1992-2021 data on grade-to-grade transition published by British Columbia Education Analytics](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-schools-grade-to-grade-transition). To gather information regarding the districts, this site also uses [information regarding each district's office, also published by the British Columbia Education Analytics](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-schools-school-district-information).

<br>

This is my JSC370 Final Project website. I will showcase a few interactive visuals here.

<br>

```{r setup, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(DT)
library(knitr)

# Initialize code chunk options
opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  eval=TRUE,
  echo = TRUE,
  cache = FALSE,
  fig.width = 7, 
  fig.align = 'center',
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  out.width = "700px",
  class.source = "code-r")
```

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.code-r { /* Code block */
  font-size: 15px;
}

.code-r-small { /* Code block */
  font-size: 10px;
}
```

<br>

## First step

First I will source any necessary code, e.g. `process_covid_data.R`:

```{r load-data}
source("process_COVID_data.R")
```

<br>

## Second step

Then I will add some code to create the **plotly** figures

Note: You need to name each code chunk, like this one: `plot1`

```{r plot1, class.source="code-r-small"}

p1_scatter <- cv_states_today %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~pop_density, y = ~deathsper100k,
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', color = ~state,
          size = ~population, sizes = c(5, 70), marker = list(sizemode='diameter', opacity=0.5),
          hoverinfo = 'text',
          text = ~paste( paste(state, ":", sep=""), paste(" Cases per 100k: ", per100k, sep="") , paste(" Deaths per 100k: ",
                        deathsper100k, sep=""), sep = "<br>")) %>%
  layout(title = "Population-normalized COVID-19 deaths vs. population density",
                  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths per 100k"), xaxis = list(title = "Population Density"),
         hovermode = "compare")

# filter out "District of Columbia"
cv_states_today_scatter <- cv_states_today %>% filter(state!="District of Columbia")

p2_scatter <- cv_states_today_scatter %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~pop_density, y = ~deathsper100k,
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', color = ~state,
          size = ~population, sizes = c(5, 70), marker = list(sizemode='diameter', opacity=0.5),
          hoverinfo = 'text',
          text = ~paste( paste(state, ":", sep=""), paste(" Cases per 100k: ", per100k, sep="") , paste(" Deaths per 100k: ",
                        deathsper100k, sep=""), sep = "<br>")) %>%
  layout(title = "Population-normalized COVID-19 deaths vs. population density",
                  yaxis = list(title = "Deaths per 100k"), xaxis = list(title = "Population Density"),
         hovermode = "compare")
```

<br>

## Third step {.tabset}

Create tabs to display each figure

### Scatterplot: with DC

```{r p1}
p1_scatter
```

### Scatterplot: without DC

```{r p2}
p2_scatter
```

## {-}

<br>

Done!
